Random useful scripts I created for a specific one-time tasks. 

ChangeADNumberFormat.ps1
 - This script replaces a character within all phone number fields for every user in Active Directory.

RemoveLocalAdmin.ps1
 - This script connects to each Windows 10 computer in the domain and removes the local admin account named 'admin'.

 CheckAccounts.ps1
  - This script takes a list of account names and checks Active Directory to see if they exist and if they are enabled.
